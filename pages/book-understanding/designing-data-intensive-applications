1. Foundation of data systems
    1.1. Reliability, Scalability, Maintainability

        - The problems are the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing

        - Data system (Data intensive system) operations:
            + Store data (databases)
            + Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
            + Search by keyword or filter in various ways (search indexes)
            + Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream processing)
            + Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)

        - Many applications have such demanding or wide-ranging requirements that a single data tool can no longer meet all of needs => Difference data tools (components) are combined together using application code to handle the job (Figure 1-1)

        - Dependencies of data system designing:
            + Skils and experience of people involved
            + Legacy system dependencies
            + Time for delivery
            + Organizationâ€™s tolerance of different kinds of risk
            + Regulatory constraints

        - Reliability: A Fault-tolerant System
            + We have 2 approaches to increase fault tolerance of system:
                . Increase the rate of faults by triggering them deliberately (The Netflix Chaos Monkey is an example of this approach) => This approach is usually used to handle faults which can be cured
                . Prevent the faults (security faults, ...) => This approach is used to handle faults which can be cured (because no curse exists)

            + Faults that can be cured:
                . Hardware Faults:
                    - Hard disks have mean time to failure (MTTF) of about 10 to 50 years.
                    
                
                . Software Faults:

                . Human Errors:
